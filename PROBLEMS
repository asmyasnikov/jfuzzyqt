1) Decomposition problem.
   In boolean logic following expressions is equal:
      IF a IS a1 THEN c IS c1;
   and
      IF a IS a1 AND (b IS b1 OR b IS b2 OR b IS b3) THEN c IS c1;
   where b consist of values b1, b2, b3 (divisible group of exclusive values).
   In fuzzy logic this expressions is not equal.
   See examples: decomposition1.fcl and decomposition2.fcl.
2) Not impliment following operaors:
      defuzzifier: COA, COGF, LeftMostMax, RightMostMax, MeanMax;
      fuzzifier  : Cosine, DSigm, Function
3) Not implement optimization of knowledge base.
